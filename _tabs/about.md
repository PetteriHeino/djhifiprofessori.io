## DJ Hifiprofessori, how the legend was born?

The name DJ Hifipofessori / DJ Professor Of Hi-Fi originated sometime in the 90s, when I was DJing at a private party. Naturally, I was very hi-fi oriented, and I didn't understand anything about the equipments, and half of the media played at the evening were C-cassettes like a real DJ would do, eh...

Of course the DJ was also a little drunk, so what happened is that I managed to lose track of the songs on the cassettes which led to long gaps between the songs while I was rewinding them and trying to find right songs. My friend at the time stood next to me and laughed at my actions, commenting on it with irony like "Hell... You're the real hi-fi professor, aren't you! Now try playing that f**kin' music, please"

Hi-fi Professor stuck with me ever since. That's how my friends back then was callin' me "Hifi" or "Professori". I was playing a guitar in the band and I decided that "Professor Of Hi-Fi" will be my artist name. After that there wasn't a real band activities anymore but that name stuck with me a long time.

Decades after, my friend Heikki organized a private party and asked if I would come to the party to play records as a DJ. I thought for a while about what DJ name I woud use and ended up choosing the old familiar name Hifiprofessori as my DJ name. That was actually the first gig of anykind with the name Hifiprofessori.

Year passes by and I started to think that playing the records at the party was fun and it could be interesting to start doing DJ gigs regularly. So we arranged a public DJ gig with the same 3 DJs that played at the party of Heikki. After that I have been playing DJ gigs with the name DJ Hifiprofessori (my finnish artist name, internationally I use the name DJ Professor Of Hi-Fi, of course... :D)

### DJ Style

My motto is "(Garage) punk DJ with a roots music twist".

Garage rock, power pop/pop punk, rock'n'roll and surf rock are the main genres I am playing on my gigs.

I also play other genre's as well which is that "twist" in my sets. Genre's like: Rockabilly, psychobilly, rhythm'n'blues, country and alternative country, soul especially girl groups, yé-yé, funk, cumbia, boogaloo, ska, rocksteady, reggae, swing, bluegrass, folk punk, exotica etc... Sometimes it's more than just a twist, sometimes just a little spice to spice up the set.

As a teenager I was a metalhead but before my twenties I got bored with metal music. I started listen to punk and alternative rock. Soon I found garage rock and a minor label releases. My mind flipped once again when I fell in love with The Cramps. I went "all in" to garage rock, rock'n'roll and psychobilly. Later my musical taste started to expand towards oldies music in different genres. I had already listened a lot of 60's garage rock, but that expanded to other oldies genre's aswell.

I am kinda strange creature as a DJ because I have my style, i know what suits to my style and what doesn't, but I play a lot of different genres. Often people get stuck in a certain genre and act like genre police, but I don't care about genre boundaries. For example, there was a time in Finland when rockabillies and punks fought each other... and me, I play both genres smoothly in my sets and I don't care much about that ugly history.

I approach every DJ gig thinking that it's a party. The music should be high quality, energetic and above all, rolling. Music that makes you want to play air guitar and even the most reserved people dance their socks off. The music must be uplifting and fun!

The media I use on my gigs is vinyl records only. No c-casettes anymore! Mostly 7" singles.

### Gigs

I live in Lahti (Finland) which naturally means that I am looking for the gigs in Lahti area.

In addition to Lahti, I am interested in playing records in Helsinki and maybe Tampere, as well as in smaller towns near Lahti. 

Contact me if you are looking for a DJ with my DJ profile. The venue must have turntables, a mixer and sound system.
